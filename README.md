Handle missing values and inconsistent data types

Detect and cap outliers (IQR method)

Convert text variables to lowercase and encode Yes/No into binary

Merge datasets using appropriate join keys

Create new variables such as ROI and purchase decision indicators

Produce an analysis-ready merged dataset (merged_soc_infl.csv)
